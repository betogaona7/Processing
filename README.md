# Learning "processing" 

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

The program Web Cam 3D uses the computer camera and transform the video into a 3D video. For that you first need to add the openGL library to your [processing IDE](https://processing.org/). You can do that if you go to `Sketch` --> `Import Library` and select `OpenGL`. After that you'll be able to run the program.
